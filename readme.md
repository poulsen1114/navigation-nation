## Description

This project implements a navigation menu with a responsive design and animated slide-in and slide-out effects for each menu item. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the desired functionality. The navigation menu is displayed as a full-screen overlay with a semi-transparent background. Each menu item has a unique background color, and hovering over an item scales it up and adds a horizontal line below it.

## Demo

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can interact with the navigation menu by clicking on the menu bars icon in the top right corner. This will open the overlay with the menu items sliding in from the left. Clicking the menu bars again will close the overlay, and the menu items will slide out to the left. Hovering over each menu item will scale it up and display a horizontal line below it.

Feel free to customize the project by modifying the CSS styles, colors, and animation timings to match your needs.
